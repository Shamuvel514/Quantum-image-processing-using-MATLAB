# Quantum-image-processing-using-MATLAB
 A MATLAB project comparing Classical and Quantum-Inspired VLSI Edge Detection methods, featuring timing and PSNR analysis for space-grade image processing applications.
# ðŸš€ Quantum-Inspired vs Classical VLSI Edge Detection (MATLAB)

This project compares classical edge detection using traditional VLSI-friendly algorithms with a simulated quantum-inspired edge detection method. The goal is to explore performance improvements and evaluate the feasibility of quantum concepts in radiation-hardened VLSI image processing for space applications.
